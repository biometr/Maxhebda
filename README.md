 #### Here are some recent projects that I decided to create from scratch :
 Start Date | Project Name | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description | Languages
 ----------- |:---:| ------------ | --- |:---:
 20.09.2020 | [Labyrinth](https://github.com/Maxhebda/Labyrinth#labyrinth) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/Labyrinth/blob/master/projectScreenImage/Labyrinth06.png" width=150 /> | Development of an algorithm for generating a maze. Normal and spiral mazes are currently generated. Algorithms for finding the exit from the maze. | c++ <br> QT Creator
 12.08.2020 | [SudokuMaxSolver](https://github.com/Maxhebda/SudokuMaxSolver#sudokumaxsolver) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/SudokuMaxSolver/raw/master/projectScreenImage/SudokuMaxSolver1.png" width=150 /> | Program for generating and solving Sudoku. Development of algorithms that generate Sudoku of varying difficulty. Development of an algorithm to solve Sudoku - brute force. Developing an algorithm for solving manual sudoku. The program is very helpful - it helps you solve sudoku step by step. | c# / WPF <br> VS
 26.08.2020 | [Trains](https://github.com/Maxhebda/Unity_Trains#trains-game) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/Unity_Trains/raw/master/projectScreenImage/Trains3.png" width=150 /> | A game written in Unity2D c# on Android for my two-year-old son. Programmed interaction. Moving trains, flying planes and balloons, a busy street, sounds. The second board: soap bubbles, clocks, batteries. | c#<br>Unity2d<br>VS
 29.06.2020 | [Tetris Max](https://github.com/Maxhebda/TetrisMax#tetrismax) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/TetrisMax/raw/master/projectScreenImage/TetrisMaxGif.gif" width=150 /> | Tetris written from scratch. The elements consist of hard and soft blocks. When the element hits the ground, its soft parts fall lower. Various sounds and animation for scoring have been added to the game. | c++ <br> QT Creator
 25.04.2020 | [The Game Of Life](https://github.com/Maxhebda/The-game-of-life#the-game-of-life) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/The-game-of-life/raw/master/projectScreenImage/playsInLife.gif" width=150 /> | Designing a program and an algorithm simulating the life of cells according to a cellular automaton. See Wikipedia -> [Link](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gra_w_%C5%BCycie) | c++ <br> QT Creator
 20.05.2020 | [Sokoban Max](https://github.com/Maxhebda/SokobanMax#sokobanmax) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/SokobanMax/raw/master/projectScreenImage/SokobanMax1.png" width=150 /> | I wrote a popular game -> Sokoban (the game is about placing all the diamonds in the holes). My game has a teleportation that allows diamonds to be pushed through. I also created the possibility to edit and create my own files with boards. | c++ <br> QT Creator
 25.06.2020 | [Langton's Ant](https://github.com/Maxhebda/AntAlgorithm#cellular-automaton---langtons-ant) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/AntAlgorithm/raw/master/projectScreenImage/algorytm_Mrowka.png" width=150 /> | Langton's Ant - a simple cellular automaton invented and described by Chris Langton in 1986. It can also be thought of as a very simple Turing machine, extended to two dimensions. In each step, one cell called the "ant" is distinguished, which, in addition to the color, also has a specific direction in which it is moving. See Wikipedia -> [Link](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr%C3%B3wka_Langtona) | c++ <br> QT Creator
 02.05.2020 | [Saper Joker](https://github.com/Maxhebda/SaperJoker#saperjoker) | <img src="https://github.com/Maxhebda/SaperJoker/raw/master/projectScreenImage/SaperJoker2.png" width=150 /> | SaperJoker is a regular "SAPER" game. The problem is that not all numbers are displayed, but only the Joker icon. Joker means there is a mine next to it. | c++ <br> QT Creator

You can find the rest of my projects directly on github :smiley:. Just don't get scared :scream: xD

*I plan to write a game -> `CHESS`, with some level of intelligence.
<br>In addition to programming, I love looking at the sky at night and watching the stars, reading technical news and playing with my son.:punch::family::muscle:*
